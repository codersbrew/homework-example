## Description

  

A client wants you to retrieve data from a RESTful API and aggregate it for them. The HTTP API has two endpoints to gather data from. The relationship between the two types of data are that of a parent and child relationship, Campaign is the parent and the Creative is the child. The Creatives contain metric data that can be used to describe the overall performance of the parent Campaign item.

  

### API Endpoints

clicks

  

Impressions and Clicks should be aggregated for the specific associated Campaign
